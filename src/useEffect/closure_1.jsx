import { useState } from 'react';

// in this example, JavaScript closures is demonstrated.
export function App() {
  // important: The count variable is different every time this component is rendered!
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // the log() function is created upon _every_ render. It captures the value of count each time.
  //
  // E.g., if the count is incremented to 2, and the log button is then pressed, the value count = 2 is captured
  // and logged 3s later.
  //
  // However, if the following sequence is executed instead:
  //
  // 1. count is incremented to 2.
  // 2. Log button is pressed.
  // 3. count is _immediately_ incremented to 4.
  //
  // the log() function will _still_ only log 2. This is due to the fact that at the moment when log() is created,
  // it captures count = 2, and that value remains the same throughout the function's execution.

    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log('Count: ' + count);
